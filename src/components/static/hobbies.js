                   One of my biggest hobbies since many years ago is music, I am a bass player in a band and I play guitar in my free time, I also like to do all kind of electronic circuits design of synthesizers to make music with them at some point.

                    When I was a kid I used to take apart all my electronic toys to know how they worked inside (and I was also one of those who later didn't know how to put them together) in order to learn how things work inside. Thanks to that I was able to win first place for several years in science fairs or robotics competitions at school and electronics has remained a hobby ever since.

                    Currently the hobby to which I dedicate more time is programming, I'm constantly watching videos, reading blogs or even reading books to improve my programming techniques and expand my knowledge in the areas that I like.
